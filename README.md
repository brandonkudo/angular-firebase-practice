# MovieStore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

##Process

I wanted to brush up on using both Firebase and Angular because I still don't feel 100% confident in my ability to use either.  My process basically entailed trying to redo the course material involving both and basically try to get a better grasp of how things work in it.  This project is still a bit buggy, but there are a lot of things I definitely understand a bit better after having done the same exercises multiple times and by myself.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
